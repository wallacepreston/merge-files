# Merge Files

## What it Does

A simple program (or script, in bash) that reads in two text files, creates a third file, merges the first two into the third, and lists the output (content of the third file).

## To Run

In this directory in bash, run the command:

`npm start`

This will take the two files `1.txt` and `2.txt` and create a third file, `3.txt`, printing the content of the third file to the terminal. This simply concatenates the two into the third file.

## To Start Over

In this directory in bash, run the command:

`npm run restart`

This will delete the third file: `3.txt`
