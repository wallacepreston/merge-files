# Merge Files

## What it Does

A simple program (or script, in bash) that reads in two text files, creates a third file, merges the first two into the third, and lists the output (content of the third file).

## To Run

In this directory in bash, run the command:

`sh merge.sh`

This will take the two files and create a third file, printing the output to the terminal. This simply concatenates the two into the third file.

## To Start Over

In this directory in bash, run the command:

`rm -r 3.txt`
